        <p class="aboutMeText">
            After serving eight years in the U.S. Army, I gained the skills necessary to work in a team, discipline, and the ability
            to pay attention to detail. Later, I earned a bachelor's degree in microbiology with honors and became a science
            enthusiast. Both paths were rewarding, but I found my true calling in technology. I have always been an analytical
            thinker and enjoy methodically solving problems, so programming was a natural fit. Now, with experience in web
            development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have a passion to create novel and valuable web applications.</p>
